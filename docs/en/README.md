# About Staking for $IO Workers

### Why Stake IO

In the context of io.net, staking is a collateral requirement for receiving block rewards. Before staking was introduced, all supported devices received block rewards.

Now, to receive block rewards, you need to stake the required amount of IO, which depends on the multiplier and the number of GPUs in a single worker.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, io.net is launching staking only for workers. Later, they promise to expand it to everyone.
